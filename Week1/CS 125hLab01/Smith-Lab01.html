		<h1>Lab 1 - Intro to the Internet, the WWW, and HTML by Brandon Smith</h1>
		<hr>

		<h2>Concept Questions</h2>

		<h3>What is the difference between the World Wide Web and the Internet?</h3>
		<p>
			The Internet is a group of interconnected Wide Area Networks
			(WANs) connected by Internet Exchange Points (IXPs). The
			World Wide Web (WWW) is a part of the Internet that allows
			users to access information through a variety of protocols
			such as Dynamic Naming System (DNS) that translates Internet
			Protocol (IP) addresses to Uniform Resource Locators (URLs),
			the HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) that requests webpage
			information from servers, and Transport Layer Security (TLS)
			that creates a secure HTTP connection (HTTPS). These WWW
			protocols are used on top of Internet protocols such as
			Transmission Control Protocol (TPC), Internet Protocol (IP)
			(which are often used together), as well as the User Datagram
			Protocol (UDP).

		<h3>In Figure 1-1 in the textbook (The components of a web application)
			,which of the 5 concepts pictured would be a <em>client</em>?</h3>
		<p>
			A tablet and a smartphone since they can use web browsers
			to request web pages from a web server.
		</p>

		<h3>What does each letter in the initialism HTTP represent?</h3>
		<p>
			<b>H</b>yper<b>T</b>ext <b>T</b>ransfer <b>P</b>rotocol
		</p>

		<h3>How is the server role different when processing a static web page
			versus a dynamic web page?</h3>
		<p>
			When processing a static web page, the server send the page
			directly to the client without any modifications. In contrast,
			the content of a dynamic web page is populated by a script or
			application on the web server in response to information sent
			via the HTTP request.
		</p>

		<h3>How do web developers know which HTML tags will work in their code?</h3>
		<p>
			HTML is a standardized language and a developer can refer to a
			resource such as the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) to ensure
			the tags they are trying to use are valid.
		</p>

		<h3>Why is it important to create web pages in such a way so that they
			are accessible in the widest possible array of browsing devices,
			including non-visual devices?</h3>
		<p>
			Web sites should be coded and designed in a way that anyone can
			access them. The aesthetic component is a core part of
			responsive design where webpages scale or have different
			layouts based on the browsing device. Using good HTML coding
			practices, such as using &lt; em &gt; &lt; /em &gt; rather than
			&lt; b &gt; &lt; /b &gt; so that screen readers will know to
			emphasize the text.
		</p>

		<p>
			Universal design, or designing something in a way that it can
			be accessed by the largest audience possible, is important so
			that everyone can access the information. Some examples of
			this are writing webpage code in a way that screen readers
			can read the text, using alt-text for images so that screen
			readers can describe to the user what an image is, using
			appropriate color combinations for visually impaired users,
			and making websites that are usable without a mouse.

		<h3>What are some folder and file-naming guidelines you should follow
			for materials destined for the web?</h3>
		From <a
			href="https://developers.google.com/style/html-formatting">
			https://developers.google.com/style/html-formatting</a>
		<ul>
			<li>Use lowercase letters</li>
			<li>Names should start with a letter and only contain letters,
			numbers, and hypens. Hyphens are better for SEO since they are seen
			as spaces. </li>
			<li>Consistenly use the same extension e.g. .html or .htm</li>
			<li>Make names short but descriptive</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>List the steps to view the HTML code for any web page from within
			the browser window. Please specify which browser you are working
			with.</h3>
		<p>
			My default browser is Safari so to view the HTML code I can
			right click a page and then click on <em>Show Page Source</em>.
			I can also access more detailed information by making the
			Develop menu show up in Settings.
		</p>

		<h3>List the steps to open an HTML file you have saved to your hard
			drive into a text editing environment.</h3>
		<p>
			I right click the file, go to Open With..., then click Visual
			Studio Code. If it's something quick and I want a simple text
			editor, I select Sublime Text.
		</p>

		<h3>Why is it a good idea for web developers to have multiple web
			browser applications installed?</h3>
		<p>
			Browsers can render webpages differently, especially dynamic
			pages. Web developers should have a variety of browsers so
			they can ensure that the page looks and functions like it is
			supposed to for a variety of users. I have seen this sometimes
			with website that work in Chrome and Firefox, but give warnings
			about Edge or Safari. I think web developers should also test
			out various browser extensions. For example, I cannot use
			<a
				href="https://www.clackamas.edu">https://www.clackamas.edu</a>
			without disabling the 1Blocker extension I use in Safari.
		</p>

		<h3>What is meant by the term "Responsive Web Design"?</h3>
		<p>
			Responsive web design is designing websites that look good on
			different devices so that they are readable and look good
			anywhere they are viewed. This is necessary so for universal
			design so that our websites are accessible to as many
			audiences as possible.
		</p>

		<h3>You need to validate your web page (stat!), what do you do? And why
			do you need this?</h3>
		<p>
			I would use the W3C validation extension in VS Code to validate
			my pages as this would be quicker than uploading them to a
			website. Validation is needed so that our website complies with
			coding standards which makes our website more likely to be
			rendered correctly across most browsers and therefore accessible
			to more users.
